**Your answer:**
Increasing k on our case improved generaliztion for unseen data until k=5, for k > 5
increasing k leaded to decreasing of the accuracy.
We can assume that ~5 closest neighbors of most of the test samples placed close enough to indicates the label
of the test sample while using bigger k pushed far and unrelated "neighbors" to the prediction which led to 
lower accuracy on unseen data.
